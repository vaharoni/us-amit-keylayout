# us-amit-keylayout
Since Karabiner is no longer supported in macOS Sierra, and Karabiner-elements does not allow mapping the section key (ยง), and a keylayout file does not allow mapping into shifts, we need to do two things.

First, install Karabiner-elments:
https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements

Then map the `grave_accent_and_tilde` key to `left_shift`.

Second, download the keylayout file in this repo to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`, logout, log-in.
Then go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources -> Plus.
You'll find the new keyboard under "Others".
